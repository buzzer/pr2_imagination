# Gazebo simulation interface

This package provides applications and tools to run the RACE system and Gazebo
simulation in an automated manner or interface Gazebo during run-time.
Applications include an Gazebo (ROS) interface class as well as a YAML parser
class parsing the RACE Fluent format. 

Included are:


1. **multisim/**: Run PR2 and Gazibo simulation within the same ROS network (roscore)
2. **race_imagination/**: Launch multiple TAMS PR2 instances on dedicated PCs and map topics.
3. **race_simulation/**: Dummy package.
4. **race_simulation_run/**: Launch TAMS PR2 Gazebo scripts.
5. **simulation_ros_api/**: Simulation ROS API.
6. **topple_scenarios/**: Multiple peppermill toppling scenarios.
